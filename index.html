<p>You can install <a href="https://github.com/joshuaclayton/homebrew-formulae">my formulae</a> via <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> with <code>brew tap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew tap joshuaclayton/formulae&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Next, run:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install unused&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>To update to the latest available version of Unused:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew update&#x000A;$ brew upgrade unused&#x000A;</code></pre>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p><strong>Unused code is expensive.</strong> People have a limited amount of room in their working
memory; by filling working memory with unused code when dissecting a problem,
developers are immediately at a disadvantage as there's less room to reason
about parts of the codebase that are actually in use.</p>

<p>I like cooking, so here's an analogy.</p>

<p>Imagine you're cooking dinner, and you're washing dishes as you go. An empty
sink when you're washing dishes means your hands are free to organize things,
to work more quickly, to speed through simple tasks and continue onward.</p>

<p>Unused code would be working with a sink stacked high with flatware, dishes,
knives. It will actively slow you down, but once those items are removed,
you're able to operate more freely again.</p>

<h3>How?</h3>

<p>Unused leverages work done by <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">Exuberant Ctags</a> by <strong>collecting the list of
tokens</strong> and <strong>searching the codebase</strong> with <a href="http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/">the Silver Searcher</a> for each
occurrence. With those results, it classifies occurrences into different
buckets, determining if it's part of the test suite.</p>

<p>Once searching is complete, it <strong>analyzes usage patterns</strong> based on general
guidelines and <strong>calculates a likelihood</strong> for whether it's able to be removed;
in Rails for example, controller names (<code>UsersController</code>) are likely never
referred to by that exact name; instead, the Rails router uses a symbol to
refer to it instead (e.g. <code>resources :users, only: [:index, :show]</code>).</p>
